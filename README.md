My recent research with Dr. Chan-Tin at Loyola University Chicago focused on website fingerprinting using deep learning, scraping a substantial dataset from high-profile sources, and testing data. This culminated in successfully scraping over 175,000 valid and unique links from notable sources such as The NYTimes and Wikipedia. Utilizing Java, Python, and bash scripting in intertwined ways not only enhanced my technical skills but also underscored my proficiency in cloud computing and data analysis. The collaborative effort further reinforced my dedication to teamwork and innovation, with Git enabling efficient project development and collaboration.
